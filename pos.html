            <h3>Learn About Cyber Security</h3>
            <h5>Welcome...</h5> to this introductory course in Cyber security.
                <br>
                This course serves as an excellent primer to the many different domains of Cyber security.
                <br><br>
                Cybersecurity is the technology and process that is designed to protect networks and devices from attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. Cybersecurity is essential for a country’s military, hospitals, large corporations, small businesses, and other organizations and individuals since data is now the cornerstone of any organization
                <br><br>
                <h5>What is the purpose of cyber security?</h5>s
Answer: Cyber security is the application of processes and controls to technology with the aim of protecting systems, networks, software, hardware, programmes, devices and data from cyber-attacks. Cyber security reduces security risks to different technological infrastructures, offering protection against the exploitation of malicious actors.

 <br><br>

<h5>Why is it important to learn about cyber security?</h5>
Answer: Cyber security protects systems, sensitive data, online privacy and the integrity of computer assets. Its purpose is to defend and offer protection against all threats no matter the nature of the individual, group or computer being targeted. It is important that everyone learn about cyber security so that they can increase their awareness and knowledge on how to act safe and responsibly online.

<br><br>

<h5>What is cyber security and why is it important?</h5>
Answer: Cyber security is the protection of sensitive data, online privacy and maintaining the integrity of essential computer assets.  It defends and protects against all threats and cyber-attacks regardless of the type of target; whether this be an individual, group or singular computer. It is important for everyone to learn and know about cyber security so that understanding, knowledge and awareness will be increased on how to act safe, secure and responsibly online.

<br><br>

<h5>Why is cyber security awareness important?</h5>
Answer: One of the largest vulnerabilities in cyber security is the human element. Oftentimes it is lack of information, training and awareness that makes system more easily accessible to cyber-attacks. So, it is essential that everyone, not just cyber “specialists” receive training and knowledge data protection, information security, defence against cyber-attacks.

<br><br>

<h5> skills are needed for cyber security?</h5>
Answer: Strong analytical skills and an eye for detail are essential for spotting trends in data and maintaining a strong awareness of potential or upcoming risks and cyber-attacks. Knowledge and training must be kept up-to-date on issues relating to computer privacy, confidentiality and other laws surrounding the access management and the protection of data, information and software.  Finally, you must have a keen interest in technology and information security.

<br><br>

<h5>Is there a demand for cyber security?</h5>
Answer: Cyber security is one of the fastest growing careers across the world today. Due to the ever-growing number of crimes, cyber security professionals and specialists are in constant demand to deal to with threats and attacks to defend and protect our online and networks security. The field of cyber is ever growing and changing creating new opportunities for not only security but also for criminal actors.

<br><br>

<h5>What is the goal of providing cyber security awareness training?</h5>
Answer: The purpose of cyber security awareness training is to develop essential skills and knowledge, introducing everyone (not just cyber specialists) to some of the tools, techniques and methods that can be used to ensure better cyber practices across the board creating more security and protection for all online. It increases employee understanding on their responsibility to protect company systems through means of confidentiality, availability and integrity, particularly in relation to an organisations data.

<br><br>

<h5>How is cyber security awareness measured?</h5>
Answer: The best way to gauge employee and company competencies when it comes to dealing cyber-attacks and the implementation of effective security protections and responses is to see how they would actually react to such events should they unexpectedly occur. Here at the GCSP the way we measure this awareness is through non-technical simulations where we create a scenario that involves a suspected cyber-attack and it is the role of the attendees of the simulation to react and respond appropriately to the circumstances provided.

<br><br>

<h5>hat is the main goal of information security awareness and training?</h5>
Answer: The purpose of information security training and awareness is to educate computer users on their responsibility towards protection, confidentiality, availability, ensuring the integrity of any data or information being used/stored. This aids in peoples understanding of their role in ensuring the security of data against potential cyber-attacks or any other challenges that may present in today's threat landscape. This training is in effort to change human behaviours mitigating risks as much as possible.  

<br><br>

<h5>How long does it take to learn cyber security?</h5>
Answer: This differs depending on the level and type of knowledge and training trying to be achieved. Simple short training courses can be used to develop a basic understanding of cybersecurity, cyber-attacks and how these can be mitigated with simple practices. For more specialist training that will ensure you become a certified professional in the cyber field will require longer training and more in-depth awareness of the field. Typically, in Switzerland, a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity will take up to 4 years to complete, if further study is chosen a Masters could then take 1-2 years and a PHD a further 3 years minimum.

<br><br>

<h5>What is cyber security awareness training?</h5>
Answer: Awareness of cyber security means that an employee or individual understands the cyber threats that could occur and what the potential impact of a cyber-attack will be on their business, computer, data etc. They will also have specialist training and understanding on the steps, tools and methods required to reduce these risks and mitigate their effects should they occur. Protection and prevention are at the forefront of this knowledge.

<br><br>

<h5>How do I train my employees for cyber security?</h5>
Answer: The best way to train an employee to learn best practices when it comes to cyber security risks, awareness and protections is to invest in employee training programmes. Here at the GCSP we offer a course on meeting the cyber security challenge which is specifically designed to increase knowledge and understanding on the essential elements pertaining to cyber security. We can also develop customised courses to suit your business needs, tailoring the information to the exact training and information you require employees to know and understand.
